# Voice Recognition Module

Using
- Python 3.6
- Library SpeechRecognition 3.8.1
- reduced PocketSphinx dictionary (pronounciation-dictionary.dict) to only match following words (and similar)
    - "left"
    - "move"
    - "right"
    - "start"
    - "stop"

## Issues
- detecting difference between "start" and "stop" without overpronouncing each of them
